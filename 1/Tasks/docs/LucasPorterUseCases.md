##User wants to continously be able to enter string data.

###User will continuosly enter input and to do functions other than entering a new string tasks
they will then enter an integer number to print or otherwise do an action.
For every modulus of 10, meaning every ten tasks, remind the user his options.

##User wants a page for every 20 tasks entered.

###Create a list with being able to access first and last and iterate through it for page
ordering. There will be a loop that will continue to execute until the user stops saying
the string "4". The numbering will be natural order.

##User wants last item entered with no actions against it to be displayed first and all
data after that to be erased if completed or crossed out.

###The list will be iterated through until there is one with noaction assigned. All of the
ones iterated through have been assigned a crossout so they will then be deleted up till
the noaction assigned value.

##Completed items should be notated by gray text

###Formatting will be assigned automatically to something that is assigned to as value
"completed"

##Current item of work will be highlighted

### This will occur in the printing format method which will include page information,
background color and foreground colors, and gray text

##Data storage should be in flat-text file

###When the user specifies save, he or she will save the data using the "2" string
